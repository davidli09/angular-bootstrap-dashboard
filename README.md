angular-dashboard
====================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard)

Dashboard/Widgets functionality with AngularJS (directive).


Features:
---------

 - Adding/removing widgets

 - Widgets are instantiated dynamically (from corresponding directive or template)

 - Widgets drag and drop (with jQuery UI Sortable)

 - Saving widgets state to local storage

 - Fluid layout (widgets can have percentage width)

 - Any directive can be a widget (e.g. AngularUI directives)

 - Connecting widgets to real-time data (WebSocket)

 - Changing widget data source dynamically (from widget options)

See [simple demo](demo) (two widgets) for a quick start.

### download

With bower:

```
bower install angular-ui-dashboard
```
Manually:

Download the zip of this repo and use the files in the `dist` folder.

### include

Load `dist/angular-ui-dashboard.js` and `dist/angular-ui-dashboard.css` in your html:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/angular-ui-dashboard/dist/angular-ui-dashboard.css">
<script src="bower_components/angular-ui-dashboard/dist/angular-ui-dashboard.js"></script>
```

Also be sure to add it to your apps dependency list:

```JavaScript
angular.module('yourApp', [
  // other dependencies
  'angular-ui-dashboard'
]);
```

### requirements

- JQuery
- JQueryUI
- AngularJS

Usage
-----

Include the dashboard directive on the element you wish to place widgets in:

```HTML
<div dashboard="dashboardOptions"></div>
```

### dashboardOptions

`dashboardOptions` in the above html is required and should be an object available on the current scope. The options on said object are as follows:


key | type | default value | required | description 
--- | ---- | ------------- | -------- | -----------
 widgetDefinitions | Array | n/a | yes | List of Widget Definition Objects. See below for available options on those. 
 defaultWidgets    | Array | n/a | yes | List of objects where an object is `{ name: [NAME_OF_WIDGET_DEFINITION] }`. TODO: Allow just list of names. 
 widgetButtons     | Boolean | true | no | Display buttons for adding and removing widgets. 
 useLocalStorage   | Boolean | false | no | If true, localStorage will be used to save the current state of the dashboard. 

### Widget Definition Objects

You can think of Widget Definition Objects as a __class__ and the widgets on the page as __instances__ of those classes. The options for a Widget Definition Object are:


key               | type     | default value | required | description 
----------------- | ------   | ------------- | -------- | -----------
name              | Object   | n/a           | true     | Name of Widget Definition Object. If no `templateUrl`, `template`, or `directive` are on the Widget Definition Object, this is assumed to be a directive name. In other words, the `directive` attribute is set to this value.
title             | String   | n/a           | false    | Default title of widget instances
attrs             | Object   | n/a           | false    | Map of attributes to add to the markup of the widget
templateUrl       | String   | n/a           | false    | URL of template to use for widget content
template          | String   | n/a           | false    | String template (ignored if templateUrl is present)
directive         | String   | n/a           | false    | HTML-injectable directive name (eg. `"ng-show"`)
dataModelType     | Function | n/a           | false    | Constructor for the dataModel object, which provides data to the widget (see below for more information).
dataModelOptions  | Object   | n/a           | false    | Arbitrary values to supply to the dataModel. Available on dataModel instance as this.dataModelOptions
dataAttrName      | String   | n/a           | false    | Name of attribute to bind `widgetData` model


### dataModelType

The best way to provide data to a widget is to specify a `dataModelType` in the Widget Definition Object (above). This function is used as a constructor whenever a new widget is instantiated on the page. Here is the relevant code snippet (located in the [widget directive file](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/directives/widget.js):

```JavaScript
// set up data source
if (widget.dataModelType) {
  var ds = new widget.dataModelType();
  widget.dataModel = ds;
  ds.setup(widget, scope);
  ds.init();
  scope.$on('$destroy', ds.destroy.bind(ds));
}
```

As shown, the `dataModelType` is a constructor function whose instances are assumed to implement the following methods: `setup`, `init`, and `destroy`.

#### `setup`
This function is called once when a widget is instantiated. It takes two arguments: (1) the instance of the [`WidgetModel`](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetModel.js) constructor that corresponds to the widget instance, and (2) the scope of the widget.

#### `init`
This function is called once when a widget is instantiated. This function does not take any arguments.

#### `destroy`
This function is called when the widget is removed from the dashboard. It does not take any arguments. It should be used to clean up any listeners that may otherwise hang around, e.g. unsubscribing to a WebSocket topic or RESTful endpoint.

It is recommended to prototypically extend from the [`WidgetDataModel`](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetDataModel.js) constructor, which implements the `setup` function. [Take a look at the code here](https://github.com/DataTorrent/malhar-angular-dashboard/blob/master/src/models/widgetDataModel.js).

Here is an example way to extend from `WidgetDataModel`:

```JavaScript
angular.module('myApp')
  // Inject other services like $http here, if necessary:
  .factory('MyDataModel', ['WidgetDataModel', function (WidgetDataModel) {
      function MyDataModel() {}
      MyDataModel.prototype = Object.create(WidgetDataModel.prototype);
      MyDataModel.prototype.init = function() {
        // My custom data model setup, like subscribing
        // to WebSocket or starting a REST call interval
      }
      MyDataModel.prototype.destroy = function() {
        // My custom data model teardown, like unsubscribing
        // to WebSocket or clearing a setInterval
      }
      return MyDataModel;
    }]);
```
